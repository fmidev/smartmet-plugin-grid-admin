Grid-Admin Plugin
=================
## Introduction

The Grid-Admin Plugin is a simple plugin that offers an HTTP interface to the Content Information Storage. So, technically other system (for example, feeding systems) can use this interface for updating  and fetching content information from the Content Information Stroage

The Grid-Admin Plugin does not use the Grid Engine. Instead, it connects directly to the Content Server by using its own configuration information.

## Licence
The Grid-Admin Plugin is a part of the SmartMet Server (https://github.com/fmidev/smartmet-server), which is published with MIT-license.
