# This file contains group permissions. You should locate this file into a secure place 
# and make sure that it has correct read/write permissions.
#
# It depends on the application if it wants to use detailed permissions. Sometimes it is 
# enough to check that the user belongs to a certain group. For example, if the user is 
# a member of "admin" group, then there is no need to check indivual permissions. Notice
# that all permission must have a unique name. So make sure, that different applications
# use different permission names.

# FIELDS:
# 1 Group name
# 2 [permission,permission,...,permission]
